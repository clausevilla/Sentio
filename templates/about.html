        <h2><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our Mental Health Analysis System was developed as part of an AI research project to help individuals better understand their mental health through text analysis. The system leverages natural language processing and machine learning techniques to identify seven different mental health states in written communication: Normal, Depression, Suicidal thoughts, Anxiety, Stress, Bi-Polar patterns, and Personality Disorder indicators.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe that early awareness of mental health patterns can lead to better outcomes. By providing accessible, AI-powered analysis tools, we aim to help people recognize mental health indicators in their communication and take proactive steps toward seeking appropriate support when needed.

        <h3>Training Data</h3>
        <p>
            The underlying model was trained on a comprehensive mental health dataset from multiple social media platforms including Reddit, Twitter, and other sources. This dataset contains labeled examples of seven mental health states, providing real-world examples of how people express different mental health conditions in their communication.
        </p>

        <h3>Machine Learning Approach</h3>
        <p>
            Our system uses multi-class classification to identify one of seven mental health states with 75% macro F1-score accuracy. The model analyzes multiple linguistic features including:
        </p>



<h3>Seven Mental Health Categories</h3>
<p>Our model classifies text into one of seven mental health states, each with specific characteristics:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Normal:</strong> Balanced emotional state with no significant mental health indicators</li>
    <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Language reflecting sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, and low energy</li>
    <li><strong>Suicidal:</strong> Critical indicators of suicidal ideation requiring immediate attention</li>
    <li><strong>Anxiety:</strong> Worry-related language, fear, uncertainty, and restlessness</li>
    <li><strong>Stress:</strong> Expressions of feeling overwhelmed, pressured, or unable to cope</li>
    <li><strong>Bi-Polar:</strong> Language patterns suggesting mood fluctuations or manic/depressive episodes</li>
    <li><strong>Personality Disorder:</strong> Communication patterns associated with personality disorder characteristics</li>
</ul>
