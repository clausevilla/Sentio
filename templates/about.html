        <h2><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our Stress Detection System was developed as part of an AI research project to help individuals better understand their mental health through text analysis. The system leverages natural language processing and machine learning techniques to identify stress patterns in written communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe that early detection and awareness of stress can lead to better mental health outcomes. By providing accessible, AI-powered analysis tools, we aim to help people recognize stress patterns in their communication and take proactive steps toward better mental wellbeing.

        <h2><i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> The Technology</h2>

        <h3>The Dreaddit Dataset</h3>
        <p>
            The underlying model was trained on the Dreaddit dataset, which contains thousands of Reddit posts from various communities. This dataset provides real-world examples of how people express stress in their daily communication.
        </p>

        <h3>Machine Learning Approach</h3>
        <p>
            Our system analyzes linguistic features to predict stress levels with about 80% accuracy. Key features include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>First-person pronoun usage:</strong> Patterns in how people refer to themselves when stressed</li>
            <li><strong>Negative emotion words:</strong> Detection of negative sentiment and emotional language</li>
            <li><strong>Anxiety indicators:</strong> Specific linguistic markers associated with anxious states</li>
            <li><strong>Social connection patterns:</strong> Analysis of social language and isolation indicators</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Three Key Indicators</h3>
        <p>Our model provides insights into three critical dimensions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anxiety Level:</strong> Measures worry-related language and uncertainty expressions</li>
            <li><strong>Negative Emotions:</strong> Detects presence of sadness, anger, and frustration</li>
            <li><strong>Self-Focus:</strong> Analyzes introspective language and self-referential patterns</li>
        </ul>
