        <p>
            Our Mental Health Analysis System was developed as part of an AI research project to help individuals better
            understand their mental health through text analysis. The system leverages natural language processing and
            machine learning techniques to identify 4 different mental health states in written communication: Normal,
            Depression, Suicidal and Stress.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe that early awareness of mental health patterns can lead to better outcomes. By providing
            accessible, AI-powered analysis tools, we aim to help people recognize mental health indicators in their
            communication and take proactive steps toward seeking appropriate support when needed.

        <h3>Training Data</h3>
        <p>
            The underlying model was trained on a comprehensive mental health dataset from multiple social media
            platforms including Reddit, Twitter, and other sources. This dataset contains labeled examples of four
            mental health states, providing real-world examples of how people express different mental health conditions
            in their communication.
        </p>

        <h3>Machine Learning Approach</h3>
        <p>
            Our system uses multi-class classification to identify one of four mental health states with 75% macro
            F1-score accuracy. The model analyzes multiple linguistic features including:
        </p>



        <h3>Four Mental Health Categories</h3>
        <p>Our model classifies text into one of four mental health states, each with specific characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Normal:</strong> Balanced emotional state with no significant mental health indicators</li>
            <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Language reflecting sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, and low energy
            </li>
            <li><strong>Suicidal:</strong> Critical indicators of suicidal ideation requiring immediate attention</li>
            <li><strong>Stress:</strong> Expressions of feeling overwhelmed, pressured, or unable to cope</li>
        </ul>
