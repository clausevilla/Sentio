<section class="about-section">

        <h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> About This System</h2>
        <p>
            Our Stress Detection System was developed as part of an AI research project to help individuals better understand their mental health through text analysis. The system leverages natural language processing and machine learning techniques to identify stress patterns in written communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            The underlying model was trained on the Dreaddit dataset, which contains thousands of Reddit posts from various mental health and support communities. By analyzing linguistic features such as first-person pronoun usage, negative emotion words, anxiety indicators, and social connection patterns, our system can accurately predict stress levels with over 80% accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you're monitoring your own mental health, trying to understand emotional patterns in your communication, or simply curious about the stress indicators in your writing, our system provides valuable insights backed by advanced AI technology.
        </p>
